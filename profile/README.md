## Hi there!

For information on this organization, visit the [wcat-charter repo](https://github.com/wcat-org/wcat-charter).

To get started, we forked two projects: [Equalify](http://github.com/bbertucc/equalify) and [A11yWatch](http://github.com/a11ywatch).

Every repo marked `ragical` is from A11yWatch. The [wcat-dashboard repo](https://github.com/wcat-org/wcat-dashboard) is from Equalify.

You can contribute to the project by:
1. Adding issues to any repo
2. Joining the A11Y [#open-a11y-tools](https://web-a11y.slack.com/archives/C04JA26KPPB) channel on Slack.

We'll update the repo based on interest and our ability to sustain the work (see [Issue #2 on bbertucc/wcat-charter](https://github.com/bbertucc/wcat/issues/2)).
